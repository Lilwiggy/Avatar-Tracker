# Avatar Tracker
 Tracks various stats about avatars changed on Discord


# Do not track me!!
 I understand some people would not like their data tracked. As of right now this is a closed application which is used in private servers. When this is released there will be a `/stop` command for the bot which you can use to stop all tracking and delete your data from the database.
